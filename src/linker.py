'''This module takes a given table in the database and creates a new table based off it.  \
The new table's records simply link back to multiple records in the original table which are similar.\
This is a way of unduplicating the original tables which are essentially just log records of all\
 received data.  We also need a utility which removes duplicate records.'''
