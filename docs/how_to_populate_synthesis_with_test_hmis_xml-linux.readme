Instructions for importing HUD HMIS XML 3.0 test data in the system:

-First, follow the instructions at: http://xsd.alexandriaconsulting.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/browser/trunk/synthesis/docs/linux_synthesis_install_readme  .  
-Make sure you pull a recent copy of the source (8-9-2010: This is because we've had to modify person tables to shrink some column names.)
-Run the linux commands from a console (this presumes you have PostgreSQL database installed and running):

dropdb synthesis

createdb synthesis

-Edit ~/workspace/synthesis/installer/build/conf/settings.py .  Specifically, set:

DB_DATABASE = "synthesis"
DB_USER = "your_username_here"
DB_PASSWD = "whatever_you_set_your_username's_postgres_password"

INPUTFILES_PATH="~/workspace/synthesis/installer/build/InputFiles"

cd ~/workspace/synthesis/installer/build 

./python selector.py 

-In another console, or in a file manager, copy your input file to the InputFiles subdirectory.  Program should pick up the file and process it. 

cp ~/workspace/synthesis/TestFiles/HUD_HMIS_3_0_Instance.xml ~/workspace/synthesis/installer/build/InputFiles/

psql synthesis

-Then, inside the psql console that opens up:

select * from export; 

select * from person;
