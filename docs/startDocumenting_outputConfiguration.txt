Table [sender_system_configuration] is used to maintain the information needed to format a servicepoint feed for bowman.

It is based on the Source Table ExportID.  Every interfaced system (Source Entity) will provide an ExportID.  This export ID will be used on every transmission they send to be imported into Synthesis.

When it's time to generate an upload for Bowman (ServicePointXML), you need to run NodeBuilder.py.

Nodebuilder.py is called from the command line this way:

	python nodebuilder.py -i 8888 -s 2008-02-10 -e 2010-07-30 -r

The parameters are formatted in this fashion:

	Usage: nodebuilder.py [options] arg

	Options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -i ID, --IDconfig=ID  Configuration ID of Vendor requesting report
	  -s StartDate, --startdate=StartDate
		                start date of reporting
	  -e EndDate, --enddate=EndDate
		                end date of reporting
	  -r, --reported        Select data that has already been reported (reported =
		                True).  Omit both -r and -u to simply use date
		                selection
	  -u, --unreported      Select data that has never been reported (reported =
		                False or None).  Omit both -r and -u to simply use
		                date selection

where -i is the configuration ID
