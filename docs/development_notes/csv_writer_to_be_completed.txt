* Handling of date logic hasn't been code yet pending direction as to how it should work.

* Still need to implement incoming export ID vs. outgoing export ID (report ID)

* Each output has fields whose source columns have to be determined:
    - Export
        ExportHashing -- Unable to determine appropriate source column -- Program input vs. data input?
        Delta or Refresh -- Unable to determine appropriate source column -- Program input vs. data input?
    
    - AgencyProgram exportIndex
        DateCreated -- Date handling logic TBD
        DateUpdated -- Date handling logic TBD
    
    - SiteInformation site OrganizationID
        DateUpdated -- Date handling logic TBD
    
    - Regions siteService OrganizationID
