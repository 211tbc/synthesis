This is a reverse-engineer of the synthesis database schema.

If the objects are updated, the schema will go out of date, but it
should still be sufficient for working purposes.  (Although if
new tables are added, it should be updated as well...)

The DDL may not be totally accurate but again, should be sufficient
if someone just wants to examine the tables as SQL.

I'll export a png version of it if anyone wants to look at it.
(Unfortunately their svg export sucks.)

You can find the tool I used to build it here:

There are standalone and plugin versions.  It's free and
open source and totally awesome too.
