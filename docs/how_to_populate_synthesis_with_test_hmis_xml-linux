Instructions for importing HUD HMIS XML 3.0 test data in the system:

First, follow the instructions at: http://xsd.alexandriaconsulting.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/browser/trunk/synthesis/docs/linux_synthesis_install_readme

Make sure you pull a recent copy of the source (8-9-2010 This is because we've had to modify person tables to shrink some column names.)

Run the linux commands from a console (this presumes you have PostgreSQL database installed and running):

Dropdb your_db_name_goes_here 

createdb your_db_name_goes_here

python selector.py 

copy your input file to the InputFiles subdirectory.  Program should pick up the file and process it. 

psql (your db name goes here) 

select * from export; 

select * from person;
